Hi Pawan

James here, Head of Engineering at Fastmarkets. I noticed that you have committed some code to this repo to scrape prices
from our dashboard. I'd be really interested in having a chat with you so that I can understand what you are trying to achieve. 
Our platform exposes data in a number of ways and I think that we can come up with a solution that's better for you than scraping. 

Please get in touch with me at james.musson@fastmarkets.com.

Thanks!
